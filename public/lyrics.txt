Hate.  Hate is not knowing.  Hate is fear.   With this based world symphony.  And with my mind I try to clear up.  Anything that.  Has to deal with hate.  Has to deal with not showing your face.  This is life.  We all hold in one place.  We are all one.  Earth is one one with the sun.  Let me run.  To the field that I want to be in.   Hate is fear.  Fear is not knowing.  To hate youre in a box.  You never leave the space.  Only insecurities bring you in place.  To hate you dont wish.  Only negative thoughts run your mind.  Do time and spread much red if you can.  I say red because its an alert color.  Brings a tint into the situation.  I consider myself gray.  A neutral.  Pushing forward the hate moves back.  Fear is in the one who wont look back.  Walks on tracks with trains.  Only to say This isnt working.   Sorry for the segue back to hate.  I try not to focus too much on that word.  Still leaves me disturbed.  My nerves need to be calmed.  Experienced hate at an early age.  I didnt love school didnt know the essence of grades.  My peers would overlook and underestimate my character.  Like Im not lifes movie.  Any lesser than human.  Some called me stupid behind my back.  Some called me foolish.  Growing up made me truthless.  I lost my two friends in elementary.  I was upset about it the haters laughed at it.  I grew an outer shell.  Not mean but something I could rely onThis is a sad day.  (Based World Orchestra please come to the front).  This is the part of life where we stop and we sit and we think and we cry and we wonder and we get depressed and we get upset this is death.  This is death firsthand; horrible to see this.  Just a life form now lifeless.  Some young some old.  Some unborn some close.  Something not fair our friend taken up the stairs without notice.  You can at least tell me I_m being evicted of our friendship forever.  I wish there was a teller to tell you.  To humble out the situation.  This is bad; real bad.  Nobody understands the pain.  I can_t sleep; my heart number.  My stomach cringes at the thought.  One year processing; to fully get over what has happened.  A major loss in the family.  This is what brings us together.  Death.  That_s Sad.  Well at least.  Now.  We do know once.  We will sleep.  This is a mission you meet.  Maybe it_s not bad.  It could be sweet.  Should be sweet.  Peaceful at ease.  No longer scared to breathe.  Relieved of the need.  Can now fully rest without work or worth.  They truly deserve to be at peace with the earth.  Live on;.  Your spirit is the light for the world.  Life for the Earth.  This is the part of life where we stop and we sit and we think and we cry and we wonder and we get depressed and we get upset this is death. .  Mental slavery.  Niggas be hanging off of trees in the woods like the hood.  Its more than Martin Luther King fighting for a dream.  Watch me go against everything you believe.  They desrespect you tryna spark a dream.  Everybody knows its easy to fail but its hard to think think twice.  Im nicer than grandma with a cup of iced tea.  You see me I got ice like Ice.  Serving them ice the same color small mice.  Leaving my office he gon pay a small price.  My advice: get out of the game.  They giving me chains new car and they taking my chains.  Never with chains the chains fastened.  Im switching lanes I got away got caught in the game.  You always complain about what you aint got.  Third world countries aint even got sidewalks to walk on.  200 people on the bus.  Every busta moves harder than I ever thought.  You never lost before you ever won.  I never won Im still hungry forever young.  My soul hurt but I still move on deep feelings aside.  Feel like a clone Im trapped in the USA.  Where work is your home no work aint gon talk on the phone.  Ive been born in the war I grew up.  I seen more ever since the 28th floor.  Looked down I never seen more poverty before.  From the top you see even more I fight for the even draw.  Before you even draw Im already gone.  With the heat drawn my gun like Miami Heat youre gone.  Focused like Steve Nash I pick my brain apart.  Thinking about breathing last.  See that casket its so close its like Im a basket go away.  Step back faster like your girlfriend just dumped him faster.  Graveyard waiting trying to stay away from the hating whatever.  Fuck the locations trespassing never close those pages.  Never wanna cheat man the thiefs outrageous.  Never been a bad farmer if you put your.  Heart in it who gonna come up to you.  I dare niggas to say that Im weak you uncomfortable.  Waiting for everything man the people.  Like me and you we gotta.  Get one thing together and that thing I dont know.  But peace is the first step pepping your step.  Im not a drug dealer Im just a life liver.  Like your liver fold like an open river.  See between your eyes I can see the pain.  This is for the ones that got away.  If you ran away hope that you stay stay Based you feel me.  For real they try to take the real people.  If you got a good heart treat yourself like a President.  Cause the bagll suck you right in.  Want you to be in the grave right beside them.  Because they got a cold they want you to have a cold.  I stick by the code I let the story unfold.  I say a lot of things its been told.  Im not scared you an asshole at least I lived the dream.  My daddy make the cash flow even if the cast goes starts losing family.  Cant buy back their lifespan with any type of money.  You got one life: better live it.  Cant be a leader if youre scared to make decisions.  Living 2Pac and Biggies visions Lil B Im trapped in prison.    .  One day to live cause you living in the moment.  The past is the present the gift is my performance.  Im working for the future cause I live in a computer.  I could tell you things that Ive seen.  A lot of guns in the streets saddened dreams.  Spacebar backspace trace your steps.  Im on the block like Jahvid Best.  Smoke a lot of weed have to calm my stress.  With the thought like no money came.  My thoughts is changed step back I not my chains.  Sport pack like Im out the game Im out of your lane.  Think twice nigga follow your brain.  Ive got riches and I act the same.  Niggas is lame Im too real you want new chains.  Had to open my eyes since I got that fame.  Sit back in my partners office.  Nigga laughing reminiscing how I took them losses.  Then I promise one day if I took that loss.  Take the whole city back open up that coffin.  No sir I dont believe in Jesus.  He was saved to the world the books and preachers.  I feel weird cause I go against my own body.  You too real I got a new deal.  Niggas is fake but their money and their coupe real.  Actually whats the root of how you feel.  Found myself in church paying respect.  To the Lord like everyone else.  But the picture of the blond hair blue eyes.  Is something that I aint feeling.  I aint saying that I cant.  But I aint gon be another slave to the race.  And I got friends around the world at 21.  This is on my mind practice forgiveness.  With nobody talking when I made the wishes for real business.  Niggas fell down hopped off those fences.  Feel bad because I made mistakes.  And still got raped by the system still forgive em.  Spend your childhood in the courtroom system.  Fell down nobody gonna pick em.  No lawyer gonna pick em.  And just forgive em leaving the play nigga.  Leaving to die leaving to ride.  Im surprised he alive for real you poor you die.  And rich get killed cause of money they got.  Man the sports get money while the doctors saving lives.  9 to 5 cant even pay the bills.  We need to manage the money for builders and plumbers welders and purifiers.  The paper the lover I might go to LA for the summer.  Venice beach music open up the thunder eternal slumber    .  Please tell me whos your boss.  Cause Imma tell them that their dude.  Is lost.  And you gonna feel.  Like triple the cost.  Of course I.  Must be dumb how I get this far.  I must be real wack how I get this hard.  Niggas wanna be famous why he_.  so far.  Cant see through its like a soul.  Metaphoric to the Earth I turn anything to gold.  You waited too long dudes your dreams is old.  Better late than never go collect my cheddar.  Give my mom a few checks gonna be straight.  Forever.  You aint feeling me dogg.  My bank account was zero you aint feeling me dogg.  But I gotta be a role model.  If he wrote all above.  Lil B brand-da-dang swag.   Lets get it.  One life to live.    .  You could break me out the strait jacket.  This hip-hop is just play action.  I switch off and I keep smashing.  Im a legend fuck the rap-off.  They say I cant do my thing.  Imma build my own lane.  You come in you get ran over.  But damn you sober.  Im the god emcee like Hova.  But Im on another level and my grind is over.  I_ll put the heat on your back like youre sitting in Rovers.  And he always prayed to God Im just bringing him closer.  Feel like Im doing a bid and my mind in Angola.  You be food then Im cool they tried to get over.  I stopped picking up my phone they wont get any closer.  They watching my every step because Im living in motion.  Seen it in the hood I cant feeling is open.  They ask for my money every other day like Im asking for something.  But when I had nothing they was laughing.  They told me that Id never make it rapping.  It brings tears to see Im on top but I told you that Id make it.  14 I was living like my life was the pavement.  And I wanted to die couldnt nobody save me.  Now I save my own self and Im on and Im famous.  And I deal with the haters.  Aint nobody gonna take away what I built.  Fuck the death threats small impostors.  But really got the love but they just choosing that option.  When I started to live better they started to hate.  I still got the same brain that caught all the cases.  Ive still got the same eyes and seen all the places.  But I aint never been faking.  And its not a game its not the Trail Blazers.  Throwing shots but we dying.  And the rap game.  Its the slave trade.  No time for meditation.  Turning into robots.  The Devil is money.  Its not even human.  The people die for a piece of paper.  Its so stupid.  Man live however you do it.  I guarantee you see your life as a child.  And make you at your all just make.  Sure that you smile.  But dying every day mas look at me now.  There was hating but I never stop.  I wanted to drop but Based God.  Gave me strength in the Vans.  I gotta really notice my chance.  Make history man.  Three back I was feeling like damn. .  You dont know how I felt.  When I was washing my hands.  Off that filth that was around.  Id never be down.  One the streets Im gone.  I never be around.  Cause the hood is a lie.  Man you better wake up before youre.  Dead or surprised.  Im just trying to save myself man.  For real but they trapped in the middle.  Dont wanna go to school.  Cause the teachers too simple.  I just wanna know where I come from.  The truth tell me before I desolve.  Its connected to the woods.  The wilderness is my home.  The world say Im bad because of my color.  But they dont get the fact that I say that I love you.  People given the option to hustle.  Just take it and I swear to God if youre willing to struggle.  And once you pass the bottom you gonna make it to the top.  Its a lot of hate up in the world just make sure that you watch.    .  Back-to-back cars move after the fact.  Its like my life action-packed.  Memories just fade in caved in.  I wrote this already its like.  A double-take.  But I will never stop my love.  You cant infiltrate one in a billion.  Like Young Jeezy feeling like one in a million.  I get the chance I work harder than ever.  Anybody talking down bitch we in it together.  You seem to forget you not gonna live forever.  Why you cop that ride and you spend that cheddar.

Because of money and its worth.  Now I will never work just to work.  People dying every day.  Just to buy a t-shirt.  And why college is so expensive.
