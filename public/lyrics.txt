Lil B. 
 Based God. 
 . 
 King of rap, I can bet my money on that. 
 Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit. 
 Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on. 
 Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song. 
 Now it's '09 and I'm running with the Based God. 
 Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalms. 
 Mix and match, all I need is dro, and 1 mic. 
 1 pad, 1 pen, iPod, dim lights. 
 Feeling like a plane when it's up and it's in flight. 
 Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe. 
 This a few things that show that I'm the rawest. 
 Been to cast everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding. 
 More beef like 6 have you balding like Baldwin. 
 Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin. 
 No talkin when I'm talking, cause it's legend: pay attention. 
. 
 Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention. 
 I fucks with Soulja Boy, get money nigga. 
 Everytime I see a rapper, I think that I'm a get him. 
 In the booth or in the streets, I'm known to tear a rhythm. 
 15 and 16, eyes breaking down the system. 
 Nobody can tell me nothing, I was livin off my system. 
 Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison. 
 Watching Hot Boyz on BET, getting all these women. 
 So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em. 
 B-Town, Waterfront I put on for my city. 
 We done did it for 6 years, just reached 20. 
 A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see 20. 
 Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking God love me. 
 Everytime I hit the beat, man I do it for my Mom. 
 Working hard everyday I'mma make it where it's mine. 
 I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil Wayne do. 
 And if you ever get me, you get ate like grapefruit. 
 My first reaction was like "just chill and stay cool". 
 The rap game is slow and it just ain't cool. 
 Always jockin all my style and it just ain't you. 
 Only time I feel you, is if a based boy do. 
 Because I'm rap god and a based boy too. 
 I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute. 
 So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe. 
 And when the roof go down it reminds me of my chick. 
 Getting money off the floor because "I'm trapping like a bitch". 
 Like Gucci Mane said but it's rich nigga clique. 
 And my name is Lil B, you can call me king of rap. 
 I done did a few things and I'm never goin back. 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin who the man is. 
 Lil B for Lil Boss I'm prayin to my canvas. 
 I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses. 
 And I'm into weed, I'm gettin cheify like Kansas. 
 Words to the wise, you should fear the competition. 
 Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin. 
 And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs. 
 And you dying for this rap, because it's the only thing you love. 
 Birth of Rap.

You know I always wanted to be the best. 
 You know I always wanted to be God. 
 This is real talk. 
 It's Lil B, yeah. 
 . 
 My new name is Based God, ice cream paint job. 
 Only come out in the dim lights, vampire. 
 Shouts out to A. 
E. 
 for riding in that 6-0. 
 Move fast, stick slow, think fast, talk slow. 
 Dude tried to play me, leave him with his bitch broke. 
 Sorry for the cuss words, fuck that, curse mode. 
 Bruh did things should've been in the Hearse fo'. 
 Now I'm spittin' rap shit, gave me somethin' to live fo'. 
 Hit him with the P-9, bet it'll make his ribs show. 
 Rap game is too fake, real niggas lay low. 
 Word around town that you livin' with a halo. 
 Bet I got killers puttin' cash on Halo. 
 No XBox, shouts out to Toon, baby. 
 Free Toon, baby, free Rocky, bitch. 
 Free Rocky, free Rocky, bitch. 
 Free Toon baby, bitch, free. 
 . 
 Feel me. 
 . 
 Bruh think I'm gay cause I'm grindin' in my tiny pants. 
 Bet I'm the only goon nigga in these tiny pants. 
 Sending off shots, kickback make your wrist jam. 
 Fully-loaded thing on my arm like a wristband. 
 You don't want the Space Jam, you're better off to vacate. 
 No, it's no template to touch this, 6 Kiss, reckless. 
 Hands around your neck like a necklace. 
 Leave him screwed and chopped, have him thinking he in Texas, nigga. 
 . 
 Yeah, you know what I mean. 
 The mind is so complex when you're Based. 
 32 Levels. 
 Welcome to my world. 
 Like I said I been ready. 
 And it feels good to be here now. 
 Finally realized, who's the rawest rapper. 
 (Yes) Lil B. 
 . 
 Just cause you a rich rapper don't really mean shit. 
 I'll come to your crib and clear that whole bitch out. 
 And then blow the swish out, my mouth put the stick out. 
 I can't be high and robbing pussies with my dick out. 
 I guess I'm a show-off, take my raincoat off. 
 I'm so wet that a pussy get mad at me. 
 Switch cars, new colors, call it raspberry. 
 Got my own website with the dotcom. 
 Take it out the bag, over stove like Top Ramen. 
 I don't sell coke, my niggas look out for me. 
 They ain't wanna let me fall off the (balcony). 
 That's like losing Mike Vick on the Falcon team. 
 We a faculty, but I'm the team leader. 
 I pass you guys, I'm in the two-seater. 
 And what's wrong with you, this is hip-hop. 
 This that '09 shit, I call it Based World. 
 . 
 Based World. 
 That's what I call it, Based World. 
 You know what I mean. 
 So just to tell you, it's a wrap. 
 To anybody that thought they had it. 
 You need to think again. 
 Throw your hands up, it's Lil B for Lil Boss. 
 I need all the Based energy I can. 
 . 
 Yeah is this what you really want, you got me in the flesh now. 
 No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out. 
 Rap transparent, my see-through glasses. 
 It's incoherent, and no I'm not staring. 
 I just see through you. 
 And from your heartbeat you are soft in the middle. 
 I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside. 
 Chopper in the trunk, leave 'em soaked like a wet slide. 
 It's a part-time, rap game is my shit. 
 I'm so sick, I'm feeling so nauseous. 
 Somebody tell the Earth I'm the best now. 
 Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out. 
 Somebody tell the trees I'm here now. 
 Somebody tell the world I'm Based now. 
 See me in outer space, I'm out of reach today. 
 Celebrate for me, I'm Based for life. 
 This a celebration, bitch.

 (Verse 1). 
 In case I'm gone tonight, I told 'em I'mma ride for life. 
 X me out the game, I leave they frame with the dynamite. 
 Expertise in homicide, with my crew it's tamper with. 
 You riding in the snow with Lugz boots and the hammers. 
 Mr. 
 MC with long bananas. 
 Clips will leave you grindin'. 
 Eat em up, no Aunt Jemima. 
 Ridin' with the pump inside 'em.

 Fightin' when I'm ridin tenant. 
 Ridin' for my closest niggas.

 . 
 (Verse 2). 
 Thinking like survivors. 
 Before we enter hell, have to mentally prepare. 
 Had to dig beneath myself. 
 And make no angels in this hell. 
 When you ridin' to the death. 
 It's a secret code of honor. 
 Only shared with a few close. 
 Closer than mustache with top lip. 
 I must stash the pump six. 
 The clip like a drum stick. 
 Batter of my left fist. 
 Is Leftwich, pumped in, pump fake, pump breaks. 
 The hospital was looking like a clear lake. 
 A lotta preying/praying invertebrate. 
 Nasty when you in the haze. 
 I demonstrate, then orchestrate. 
 My weaponry is auto-tuned, autobahn the automatic. 
 Leave the shots off, leave em in a hot dog. 
 I'm ridin for my niggas bruh. 
 . 
 (Ridin for my niggas man. 
 I'm ridin' for my niggas, 6 Kiss. 
 Shit is so crazy man, 6 times though. 
 You know what I mean.

[Intro - Lil B]. 
 Fuck the Rap game. 
 It's the death of the rap game. 
 Fuck the world. 
 I'm God. 
 Lil B.

 [Verse - Lil B]. 
 I'm militant, I'm very Based, I'm very proper. 
 And you don't want a war: you bring your troops. 
 I bring the chopper. 
 Cause you niggas gay. 
 Yeah, you gay. 
 You fuckin faggot. 
 And I'm adverse with 30 rhymes I let them have it. 
 Battlefield with fast cash, you never grab it. 
 I post up with big blunts & Maseratis. 
 Rick Ross, The new whip is Big Body. 
 New Boys, you bitch-niggas I been Rocky. 
 Been cocky as y'all, I been active. 
 Ride on us, we get straps, no riff-raff. 
 Then you hold cars, we hold guns, Dodge Magnum. 
 It's tragic how he left with no comments. 
 Never settle for nigga-rich, I'm gonna rob em. 
 Catch me slippin with tiny pants, you think I'm nerdy. 
. 
 . 
45 got nice aim; I throw curvy. 
 My game: I run the court. 
 I'm James Worthy. 
 From the block, I'm from the bricks like New Jersey. 
 I did court, I did jail, you can't hurt me. 
 Waterfront and fam nigga, it's West Berkeley. 
 And they ask where I been. 
 I been rappin. 
 You drive cars. 
 You fuckin fag, I been gassing. 
 In my eyes is blood, sweat and paint, cuz. 
 It's a shame that they don't know my name, Blood. 
 Lil B: I blow trees in all seasons. 
 Think I'm slippin. 
 Find out. 
 For no reason. 
 I met pain, I met God, I met death. 
 They all say that I'm Based God, and that's that. 
 Spit sick, I spit rhymes, I spit facts. 
 I ain't Drake, I ain't come in the game rich. 
 Fuck you if you don't feel my game, bitch. 
 Fuck you if you don't like my name, bitch. 
 BasedGod tell your girl, she could suck on it. 
 Put money on God and I bust on him. 
 Don't hate. 
 I rocked out like Philly rock. 
 Wrists streetlight: a New York City block. 
 Beat your ass like a New York City cop. 
 Flipmode a Rah Digga, a mind-figure. 
 Fuck crackers, fuck hoes & fuck niggas. 
 Fuck her, fuck you & fuck me. 
 Lil B: I'm back bitch, I spit heat. 
 Post up, I sell dimes and fat zips. 
 Got crack: the cats come like catnip. 
 Don't trip: I never fold like napkins. 
 Real goon: I'm just "Robbin" like Baskins. 
 Anthrax a real boy like Osama. 
 Been played, I been beat, I love drama. 
 X-Man on defense, the street shit. 
 Riding up in deep tints & deep dish. 
 Never thought I'd come hard. 
 I fooled you. 
. 
 Ben Watson I cursed you, it's Voodoo. 
 Been locked in, Mach-10s and Mac-10s. 
 Leave his head split & no Cochran to back him. 
 What. 
 You niggas wish I'd fall of the Big League. 
. 
 At my lowest point, sacrifice to make bread. 
 XMR - call your bitch and get head. 
 She don't really like you: possum, she play dead. 
 Riding up top. 
 Real niggas in big box. 
 Say the pack dead. 
 bitch nigga the pack hot. 
 All these new niggas is my sons, the new boys. 
 Fuck you rap niggas: new guns and new toys. 
 Infrared beam make you dream the truth, boy. 
 Semi-auto rounds make you scream like Luke, boy. 
 Only other thing that I ain't did is die yet. 
 I don't like that mindset, nigga, it's the grind-set. 
 They way you watch this it could be a Timex. 
 You not a threat: my rap flow is bomb threats. 
 Stay in your house: I'm stampeding with death threats. 
 Think you hard: I bust a nut like good sex. 
 Think you real. 
 Obey nigga, a hood vet. 
 Lil B: I'm BasedGod with no stress. 
 Incest, fuck your bruh and fuck your bitch. 
 No homo.

 Mexican: I'm illegal, I move bricks. 
 No Love for dog hoes like New pits. 
 Doctor.

Chasing the Rain, I know that the game got slight change. 
 I stop hittin licks ‘cuz that shit was just chump change. 
 My dude said “B, you a god for the streets”. 
 And I ain’t see him in days, my boys hustle for keeps. 
 And you on that petty shit my bruh, felony and bank-rob. 
 I know a white girl that did 10 for a bank job. 
 Seen a lot of money, but that shit ain’t never fazed me. 
 I’m driving down 6, in the Stolo looking crazy. 
 I’m feeling like the boss, my tat game is real life. 
 You think I got a tongue because I like to rock shit. 
. 
 Bruh, I hit 40 liqs and i’m know to rock shit. 
 Put my name on the paper, shit i’m finna eat meals. 
 Only nigga from the hood 16 with a deal. 
 And I still don’t have car ‘cuz I walk around the streets bitch. 
 Young Beezy B. 
 yeah its Young Beezy B. 
. 
 And i’m coming for your crown so watch out Weezy Wee. 
 And Drizzy Drake Missy and Ol' Jay-Z. 
 We ain’t got real beef, this is lyrical shit. 
 I’m in the transplant car, call it the miracle whip. 
 Hip-Hop need a God and im ready to be crucifixed. 
 Shit, I guess you listen to these rappers. 
 They all apart of SAG ‘cuz they some really good actors. 
 Ready for the war, bring your whole fucking team out. 
 Its like Star Wars when I bring that fucking beam out. 
 A lot of haters talk, but they ain’t making no music. 
 They rather live fake, make money, then they loss it. 
 My back against the wall thats why I feel Lil Boosie. 
 I’m in the beach house with your main bitch, choosin’. 
 And I don’t play games because I ain’t fucking with them losers. 
 Because in my life time, I can’t make no excuses. 
 Came from the bottom with my knee up on my waistline. 
 Yeah. 
 I was a baller in high school. 
 Had a different whip, everyday, switchin’. 
 Cops came by and theres no need for snitchin’. 
 Because when you do that, your membrane full of stitches. 
 Code of the real: that you mind your own business. 
 Code of the block: is that you never stop grinding. 
 ‘cuz I been under pressure, thats why I love diamonds. 
 I’m a X-Man, i’m a mutant of the future. 
 Never ever thought that the quite dude might shoot ya. 
 ‘cuz loud mouth men, they immature students. 
 This my class, so i’m here every day. 
 I’m on the honor roll and i’m still a real nuisance. 
 Brang Dang Dang and i’m back, AND i’m juicin’. 
 My eyes getting red, my soul is on the canvas. 
 Painting on my body and its like you on campus. 
 Wheres homeroom, because i’m looking for the master. 
 You play games and i’m not shoot, Ted Danson(. 
). 
 But the bullets leave you dancing. 
 I’d kidnap myself, and put my music up for ransom. 
 Lil Boss, i’m handsome. 
 God damn’em bruh.

Hate. 
 Hate is not knowing. 
 Hate is fear. 
 . 
 With this based world symphony. 
 And with my mind I try to clear up. 
 Anything that. 
 Has to deal with hate. 
 Has to deal with not showing your face. 
 This is life. 
 We all hold in one place. 
 We are all one. 
 Earth is one, one with the sun. 
 Let me run. 
 To the field that I want to be in. 
 . 
 Hate is fear. 
 Fear is not knowing. 
 To hate, you're in a box. 
 You never leave the space. 
 Only insecurities bring you in place. 
 To hate, you don't wish. 
 Only negative thoughts run your mind. 
 Do time and spread much red if you can. 
 I say red because it's an alert color. 
 Brings a tint into the situation. 
 I consider myself gray. 
 A neutral. 
 Pushing forward, the hate moves back. 
 Fear is in the one who won't look back. 
 Walks on tracks with trains. 
 Only to say 'This isn't working'. 
 . 
 Sorry for the segue back to hate. 
 I try not to focus too much on that word. 
 Still leaves me disturbed. 
 My nerves need to be calmed. 
 Experienced hate at an early age. 
 I didn't love school, didn't know the essence of grades. 
 My peers would overlook and underestimate my character. 
 Like I'm not life's movie. 
 Any lesser than human. 
 Some called me stupid behind my back. 
 Some called me foolish. 
 Growing up made me truthless. 
 I lost my two friends in elementary. 
 I was upset about it, the haters laughed at it. 
 I grew an outer shell. 
 Not mean, but something I could rely on


This is a sad day. 
 (Based World Orchestra, please come to the front). 
 This is the part of life where we stop, and we sit, and we think, and we cry, and we wonder, and we get depressed, and we get upset, this is death. 
. 
 This is death firsthand; horrible to see this. 
 Just a life form now lifeless. 
 Some young, some old. 
 Some unborn, some close. 
 Something not fair, our friend taken up the stairs without notice. 
 You can at least tell me I’m being evicted of our friendship forever. 
 I wish there was a teller to tell you. 
 To humble out the situation. 
 This is bad; real bad. 
 Nobody understands the pain. 
 I can’t sleep; my heart number. 
 My stomach cringes at the thought. 
 One year processing; to fully get over what has happened. 
 A major loss in the family. 
 This is what brings us together. 
. 
 Death. 
. 
 That’s Sad. 
. 
 Well at least. 
 Now,. 
 We do know once. 
 We will sleep. 
 This is a mission you meet. 
 Maybe it’s not bad. 
 It could be sweet. 
 Should be sweet. 
 Peaceful at ease. 
 No longer scared to breathe. 
 Relieved of the need. 
 Can now fully rest without work, or worth. 
 They truly deserve to be at peace with the earth. 
 Live on;. 
 Your spirit is the light for the world. 
 Life for the Earth. 
 This is the part of life where we stop, and we sit, and we think, and we cry, and we wonder, and we get depressed, and we get upset, this is death. 



[Intro]. 
 We not gon' stop from the top to the bottom. 
 Lil B, mental, you know, niggas is trapped in prison. 
 It's time to live our life, mental, physical, all that. 
 . 
 [Verse]. 
 Mental slavery. 
 Niggas be hanging off of trees in the woods, like the hood. 
 It's more than Martin Luther King, fighting for a dream. 
 Watch me go against everything you believe. 
 They desrespect you tryna spark a dream. 
 Everybody knows it's easy to fail but it's hard to think, think twice. 
 I'm nicer than grandma with a cup of iced tea. 
 You see me, I got ice like Ice. 
 Serving them ice the same color small mice. 
 Leaving my office, he gon' pay a small price. 
 My advice: get out of the game. 
 They giving me chains, new car and they taking my chains. 
 Never with chains, the chains fastened. 
 I'm switching lanes, I got away, got caught in the game. 
 You always complain about what you ain't got. 
 Third world countries ain't even got sidewalks to walk on. 
 200 people on the bus. 
 Every busta moves harder than I ever thought. 
 You never lost before you ever won. 
 I never won, I'm still hungry, forever young. 
 My soul hurt but I still move on, deep feelings aside. 
 Feel like a clone, I'm trapped in the USA. 
 Where work is your home, no work, ain't gon' talk on the phone. 
 I've been born in the war, I grew up. 
 I seen more, ever since the 28th floor. 
 Looked down, I never seen more poverty before. 
 From the top you see even more, I fight for the even draw. 
 Before you even draw I'm already gone. 
 With the heat drawn, my gun like Miami Heat, you're gone. 
 Focused like Steve Nash, I pick my brain apart. 
 Thinking about breathing last. 
 See that casket, it's so close, it's like I'm a basket, go away. 
 Step back faster, like your girlfriend just dumped him faster. 
 Graveyard waiting, trying to stay away from the hating, whatever. 
 Fuck the locations, trespassing, never close those pages. 
 Never wanna cheat man, the thief's outrageous. 
 Never been a bad farmer, if you put your. 
 Heart in it, who gonna come up to you. 
. 
 I dare niggas to say that I'm weak, you uncomfortable. 
 Waiting for everything, man, the people. 
 Like me and you, we gotta. 
 Get one thing together and that thing I don't know. 
 But peace is the first step, pepping your step. 
 I'm not a drug dealer, I'm just a life liver. 
 Like your liver fold like an open river. 
 See between your eyes, I can see the pain. 
 This is for the ones that got away. 
 If you ran away, hope that you stay, stay Based, you feel me. 
. 
 For real, they try to take the real people. 
 If you got a good heart, treat yourself like a President. 
 Cause the bag'll suck you right in. 
 Want you to be in the grave right beside them. 
 Because they got a cold, they want you to have a cold. 
 I stick by the code, I let the story unfold. 
 I say a lot of things, it's been told. 
 I'm not scared, you an asshole at least I lived the dream. 
 My daddy make the cash flow, even if the cast goes, starts losing family. 
 Can't buy back their lifespan with any type of money. 
 You got one life: better live it. 
 Can't be a leader if you're scared to make decisions. 
 Living 2Pac and Biggie's visions, Lil B, I'm trapped in prison.

[Intro]. 
 Woo. 
 You know we in Berkely California right now. 
 Riding on the freeway. 
 Passing Emeryville, going through Oakland. 
 Shouts out to Richmond, San Francisco. 
 . 
 [Verse]. 
 One day to live, cause you living in the moment. 
 The past is the present, the gift is my performance. 
 I'm working for the future, cause I live in a computer. 
 I could tell you things that I've seen. 
 A lot of guns in the streets, saddened dreams. 
 Spacebar, backspace, trace your steps. 
 I'm on the block like Jahvid Best. 
 Smoke a lot of weed have to calm my stress. 
 With the thought like no money came. 
 My thoughts is changed, step back I not my chains. 
 Sport pack like I"m out the game, I'm out of your lane. 
 Think twice nigga, follow your brain. 
 I've got riches and I act the same. 
 Niggas is lame, I'm too real, you want new chains. 
. 
 Had to open my eyes since I got that fame. 
 Sit back in my partner's office. 
 Nigga laughing, reminiscing, how I took them losses. 
 Then I promise one day, if I took that loss. 
 Take the whole city back, open up that coffin. 
 No sir, I don't believe in Jesus. 
 He was saved to the world, the books and preachers. 
 I feel weird cause I go against my own body. 
 You too real, I got a new deal. 
 Niggas is fake, but their money and their coupe real. 
 Actually, what's the root of how you feel. 
 Found myself in church, paying respect. 
 To the Lord, like everyone else. 
 But the picture of the blond hair, blue eyes. 
 Is something that I ain't feeling. 
 I ain't saying that I can't. 
 But I ain't gon' be another slave to the race. 
 And I got friends around the world at 21. 
 This is on my mind, practice forgiveness. 
 With nobody talking when I made the wishes for real, business. 
 Niggas fell down, hopped off those fences. 
 Feel bad because I made mistakes. 
 And still got raped by the system, still forgive 'em. 
 Spend your childhood in the courtroom system. 
 Fell down, nobody gonna pick 'em. 
 No lawyer gonna pick 'em. 
 And just forgive 'em, leaving the play nigga. 
 Leaving to die, leaving to ride. 
 I'm surprised he alive, for real, you poor you die. 
 And rich get killed cause of money they got. 
 Man the sports get money while the doctors saving lives. 
 9 to 5 can't even pay the bills. 
 We need to manage the money for builders and plumbers, welders and purifiers. 
 The paper, the lover, I might go to LA for the summer. 
 Venice beach music, open up the thunder, eternal slumber .

[Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 Most people are divided up. 
 Like It's Apartheid. 
 I'm sleeping where the sharks lie. 
 Never see the snake eyes. 
 Unless you fuckin with him. 
 Always keep your distance. 
 They won't have your back. 
 But listen to every sentence. 
 Never speak a sentence. 
 You in the BasedGod's vision. 
 And if you walk with it. 
 Then it's a good decision. 
 Don't try to talk a lot. 
 Most people won't listen. 
 You can't talk to yourself. 
 To see the whole damn vision. 
 Lil B. 
. 
 . 
 One love, man. 
 It's just game. 
 I'm spittin game. 
 Throw it back to the lanes. 
 . 
 [Verse 2 - Lil B]. 
 I'm stepping in the dragon's lair. 
 With smoke in my eyes. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 Hell on Earth, can't stop them guys. 
 With death on their minds, you can't. 
 Stop their rides with drugs in the car. 
 With the eagle's eyes looking out. 
 For the cops and the needles, right. 
. 
 Back then, they were watching and fiending. 
 Like in the hood, dope man serving Jesus. 
. 
life. 
 No loyalty, no respect, no honesty. 
 Honestly I'll move away. 
 But niggas going to say that you. 
 Never lived there. 
 New Kids On The Block. 
 Putting new bids there. 
 New jails with new. 
 Bids there. 
 They waiting to put some new kids there. 
 My nigga thought they'd never get theirs. 
 Passed jail, fuck it, never lived there. 
 I'm the rawest. 
 . 
 I'm spitting game. 
 Let's get it, one live to live. 
 . 
 [Verse 3 - Lil B]. 
 Please tell me who's your boss. 
 Cause I'mma tell them that their dude. 
 Is lost. 
 And you gonna feel. 
 Like triple the cost. 
 Of course I. 
 Must be dumb, how I get this far. 
. 
 I must be real wack, how I get this hard. 
. 
 Niggas wanna be famous, why he . 
 so far. 
. 
 Can't see through, it's like a soul. 
 Metaphoric to the Earth, I turn anything to gold. 
 You waited too long, dudes, your dreams is old. 
 Better late than never, go collect my cheddar. 
 Give my mom a few checks, gonna be straight. 
 Forever. 
 You ain't feeling me dogg. 
 My bank account was zero, you ain't feeling me dogg. 
 But I gotta be a role model. 
 If he wrote all above. 
 Lil B, brand-da-dang, swag. 
. 
 . 
 Let's get it. 
 One life to live.

[Intro]. 
 Been a long time coming. 
 A lot of pain a lot of triumph. 
 Now I've come to the point where I'm happy. 
 . 
 [Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 You could break me out the strait jacket. 
 This hip-hop is just play action. 
 I switch off and I keep smashing. 
 I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off. 
 They say I can't do my thing. 
 I'mma build my own lane. 
 You come in, you get ran over. 
 But damn, you sober. 
 I'm the god emcee like Hova. 
 But I'm on another level and my grind is over. 
 I’ll put the heat on your back like you're sitting in Rovers. 
 And he always prayed to God I'm just bringing him closer. 
 Feel like I'm doing a bid and my mind in Angola. 
 You be food, then I'm cool, they tried to get over. 
 I stopped picking up my phone, they won't get any closer. 
 They watching my every step because I'm living in motion. 
 Seen it in the hood, I can't, feeling is open. 
 They ask for my money, every other day like I'm asking for something. 
 But when I had nothing they was laughing. 
 They told me that I'd never make it rapping. 
 It brings tears to see I'm on top, but I told you that I'd make it. 
 14, I was living like my life was the pavement. 
 And I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me. 
 Now I save my own self and I'm on and I'm famous. 
 And I deal with the haters. 
 Ain't nobody gonna take away what I built. 
 Fuck the death threats, small impostors. 
 But really got the love, but they just choosing that option. 
 When I started to live better, they started to hate. 
 I still got the same brain, that caught all the cases. 
 I've still got the same eyes and seen all the places. 
 But I ain't never been faking. 
 And, it's not a game, it's not the Trail Blazers. 
 Throwing shots but we dying. 
 And the rap game. 
 It's the slave trade. 
 No time for meditation. 
 Turning into robots. 
 The Devil is money. 
 It's not even human. 
 The people die for a piece of paper. 
 It's so stupid. 
 Man, live however you do it. 
 I guarantee, you see your life as a child. 
 And make you at your all, just make. 
 Sure that you smile. 
 But dying every day, ma's look at me now. 
 There was hating, but I never stop. 
 I wanted to drop, but Based God. 
 Gave me strength in the Vans. 
 I gotta really notice my chance. 
 Make history, man. 
 Three back, I was feeling like "damn. 
". 
 You don't know how I felt. 
 When I was washing my hands. 
 Off that filth that was around. 
 I'd never be down. 
 One the streets I'm gone. 
 I never be around. 
 Cause the hood is a lie. 
 Man, you better wake up before you're. 
 Dead or surprised. 
 I'm just trying to save myself man. 
 For real, but they trapped in the middle. 
 Don't wanna go to school. 
 Cause the teacher's too simple. 
 I just wanna know where I come from. 
 The truth, tell me, before I desolve. 
 It's connected to the woods. 
 The wilderness is my home. 
 The world say I'm bad because of my color. 
 But they don't get the fact that I say that I love you. 
 People given the option to hustle. 
 Just take it and, I swear to God if you're willing to struggle. 
 And once you pass the bottom you gonna make it to the top. 
 It's a lot of hate up in the world, just make sure that you watch.

[Verse 1]. 
 You can have your case, then praying on my downfall. 
 The game got me fucked up, got to fuck around y'all. 
 Straight through - zoom - like a Nascar. 
 I was the last one to get this. 
 Last one to get that. 
 Kept my head up when it rained. 
 Through my coatback. 
 I"m a lumberjack, I'm dropping. 
 Trees to the game. 
 Not talking about the plants. 
 Talking drug fame. 
 You gonna see jail. 
 The criminals never safe. 
 This came from the heart. 
 Don't look at my past. 
 I just left it in this dark. 
 I could start from scratch. 
 Multiply the truth: it's all facts. 
 You can deny I'm great, you don't rap. 
 If you something ain't real. 
 Then you don't trap. 
 From waiting at the bus stop. 
 To wearing all-black. 
 If God's real, why my friend have to die. 
. 
 Sometimes I've just got to ask: why. 
. 
 . 
 [Verse 2]. 
 Back-to-back, cars move after the fact. 
 It's like my life action-packed. 
 Memories just fade in, caved in. 
 I wrote this already, it's like. 
 A double-take. 
 But I will never stop my love. 
 You can't infiltrate, one in a billion. 
 Like Young Jeezy feeling like one in a million. 
 I get the chance, I work harder than ever. 
 Anybody talking down, bitch we in it together. 
 You seem to forget, you not gonna live forever. 
 Why you cop that ride and you spend that cheddar. 
. 
 Stack up your money, that's word to mother. 
 Love of people talking down man. 
 Living to maintain. 
 My life not made, I'm in the hood like antspray. 
 Words could kill. 
 "Why he call his album that. 
". 
 And "how the fuck he feel. 
". 
 Bitch I do what I want. 
 And the tracks is ill. 
 Remember Lil B, bitch. 
 That's that dude that's real. 
 Let's get it.

[Barack Obama]. 
 That's what's happening in America right now. 
 Change is what's happening in America.

 [Intro]. 
 We made history for the first time ever. 
 Like I said, things'll never be the same, you know. 
 Keep your head up, one love and one life to live. 
 . 
 [Hook]. 
 I'mma ask how you doing today. 
 We gon' win somehow, someway. 
 The world going through a critical change. 
 I just want us to be okay. 
 . 
 [Verse]. 
 Now I sit back, dreaming a dream (. 
) spirit. 
 Coming from my heart, I think you should listen. 
 I came from the top and hit the bottom. 
 I never came from the bottom, that's just a facade. 
 Like seeing water in the desert, this song is depressing. 
 But it's uplifting, holding on to my spirit. 
 I'm so grateful that you hear it. 
 It's so live when you quote my lyrics. 
 And the sun is coming out, chains is dead. 
 You're running a race, just pace yourself. 
 Love for ease, I live for it, I'mma take it and leave. 
 Loving my seed, all them new kids, fathers is poppin. 
 Just promise one thing, it's on the option. 
 Bring us together, now or never. 
 Part through the crowds just to see the weather. 
 I got enough room to take us together. 
 More real friends: let's get this cheddar. 
 Last but not least, the cheddar. 
 I'm down for whatever, don't forget I down forever. 
 This is my letter to my fans of 2011. 
 Things have changed, I do accept it. 
 This is Lil B (. 
). 
 We gonna live forever, Based World.

 [Outro]. 
 Yeah, there is a change but you know, it's not bad. 
 Let's live this one life we got.

[Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 Don't worry about the mishaps. 
 Chin straps, headlock. 
 We all got the same rise. 
 We all got the same drop. 
 2011: we all in the same pot. 
 Make a choice, you have a voice. 
 Back then, we was parted by the masters. 
 Gave us religion so we couldn't move past it. 
 In reality it's all about the Earth. 
 People turn their back. 
 Because of money and it's worth. 
 Now I will never work just to work. 
 People dying every day. 
 Just to buy a t-shirt. 
 And why college is so expensive. 
. 
 People wanna learn, but there's always some fences. 
 I tell you like that. 
 I move with forgiveness. 
 People always wanna cut. 
 But not with precision. 
 I guess that we're gifted. 
 This is one life to live and I'mma live it. 
 Fuck the critics, I'm happy: Lil Boss. 
 . 
 I'm from Waterfront, Bay Area. 
 California man. 
 . 
 Lil Boss: party, no party. 
 People still rocking. 
 Young Based God, no way to stop me. 
 Stop with the hate. 
 The cowards watching. 
 Signed a couple checks. 
 I ain't talking deposits. 
 This change for. 
 This is wannabe gangstas. 
 People that get lost. 
 No walks with the strangers. 
 Had no friends. 
 I was looking for an angel. 
 Wanted the floor map. 
 But I ain't have no angles. 
 Now every time I see the flag. 
 I salute to the thugs. 
 The flag salutes back. 
 That's America for us. 
 People die just to speak to the. 
 Freedom before us. 
 Now we pleading for more stuff. 
 We can watch over. 
 There's clones in the hood. 
 Everybody is a soulja. 
 And everybody with this shit. 
 But don't nobody wanna teach nobody. 
 Wanna get sick, but get caught for the crime. 
 That's why I keep it so real. 
 Life after life, we might not talk. 
 But I'm fine. 
. 
. 
 I'm at peace, one love man, fixed that beef. 
 Can't nobody do it like that boy Lil B. 
 . 
 That's real shit. 
 Tell muthafuckas to sample that.

[Goo Goo Dolls Sample]. 
 Don't want the world to see me. 
 Don't think that they'd understand. 
 Everything's meant to be broken. 
 Want you to know who I am. 
 . 
 [Lil B - Verse 1]. 
 My lifetime came from struggle. 
 All I've seen is what I follow. 
 My skin color, automatic transaction. 
 I'm already classified, no second chance. 
 Taught to feel nappy hands, little grade. 
 Why can't I sag when it's just a style. 
 Little beard, black hoodie, and I'm all good. 
 People judge before they even know me. 
 Stare at me, don't know I'm lonely. 
 Outside's from these stares from police. 
 And I get the bad rap because another man that just looks like me. 
 Think life's a movie like Spike Lee. 
 Too cool like Ice T. 
 Yeah, I move with Life's Peace, and he move with the gun piece. 
 So there's no peace. 
 I gotta go to the hood, all I see is. 
 Divided, the freshest schizophrenics. 
 Men pimping women, people losing vision. 
 Given choices before she started living. 
 I hate myself. 
 . 
 [Lil B - Hook]. 
 I see myself in the mirror, but I don't see nothing. 
 If you understand what I'm seeing please tell me something. 
 When you black, the media make you wonder why. 
 I just need my history, because I hate myself. 
 . 
 [Lil B - Verse 2]. 
 It makes me sad to see pimping like I'm at a battle with my surroundings. 
 Everybody do it, but not really. 
 And I couldn't imagine my momma. 
 Universal knowledge is karma. 
 I see young girls hanging off the corner. 
 And they searching for love in the wrong space. 
 Gave her mind to a pimp, now he's changing faces. 
 Sometimes I just wish I could trade places. 
 I hate myself for being taught the roots of the hood. 
 Which don't matter, no respect and no love. 
 That got jailed for the real thugs. 
 And I'm sorry to all the innocent in prison. 
 You get a second chance when you free or in heaven. 
 I promise if you really love and you watch your steps. 
 Respect everybody, man you will get blessed. 
 Get your point across without violence. 
 The black dying by the gun, I'm tired of crying. 
 I hate myself. 
 . 
 [Lil B - Hook 2]. 
 For real man, this been in my heart for a long time. 
 And if you understand, please tell me something. 
 When you black, the media make you wonder why. 
 . 
 [Lil B - Verse 3]. 
 I'm ready to give up my old thoughts. 
 I'mma move past what I saw. 
 I'mma do what I want and be happy. 
 I'm not gon' rob or kill to survive. 
 Everything I've seen was a lie. 
 I'm not ready to die, I love myself. 
 I said. 
. 
. 
. 
 Everything that I've seen was a lie. 
 I'm not ready to die, I love myself. 
 Break that mental.

 You know we are free now man. 
 Break that, uh, mental blockage. 
 Don't think too hard, free your mind.

 And never fold over. 
 Fucking with my grind.

 Respect mine all the time. 
 Press rewind. 
 Lil Wayne said I'm a Lil Boss. 
 Want that Wayne bread, never gonna leave my head. 
 2 G's, real G's make your face bleed. 
 Real nigga, trill niggas like Pimp C. 
 Speak my mind, because it's free speech. 
 Niggas scared to make a difference. 
 Bitch I'm back for a vengeance. 
 Didn't play much with precision. 
 Rap like I'm making new dreams. 
 Keep up. 
 Top of the whole atlas. 
 Right or wrong. 
 Just do it boy, we living life. 
 Autopilot fell asleep driving. 
 I can never see what they see. 
 It's like me times two. 
 Money on my mind like a nosebleed. 
 You got tricks up your sleeve.

 So what.

 Keep my head up high. 
 Keep em real high. 
 Because the money in the sky. 
 I'm telling the truth. 
 Said I wouldn't be in my heart.

 Why niggas don't keep it real no more.

 Leaning on the next man. 
 Trying to get some dough. 
 And I ain't making a diss. 
 This really exists. 
 Last time I made love is. 
 When I wrote this song. 
 People: you saying "B. 
 You should be a preacher". 
 Like I told em far back. 
 I'mma be a teacher. 
 I told em one day. 
 That we gonna reach it. 
 This is cut down on songs. 
 I don't got no features. 
 Keep my squad close like we .

 I don't got greedy, man. 
 The fame is enough. 
 And for people trying to hate. 
 Saw my money. 
 Karma is real, and you gotta love it. 
 I could take a few trips in advance. 
 Look. 
 I'm flying to the snow and. 
 I visit the sand, see. 
 Life's real, when you're tied up in Japan man. 
 My face is in the streets. 
 You have my picture in your hand.

 Just to see you, but she don't know. 
 That the game is played, try to. 
 Say she love me. 
 Naw, you love my fame. 
 Cause real life: you don't know my name. 
 You just know my lane. 
 BasedWorld: it's a gorgeous game. 
 I gained twice. 
 Y'alls after the catch. 
 I'm on the dip like I'm on the Mets. 
 On TV like I"m on the Nets. 
 Bet I throw bombs like I'm on the Jets. 
 How much I'm worth. 
 I should make you guess. 
 How much I work. 
 It'll make you stress. 
 I work hard like I'm living check-to-check. 
 I made my mind up, I'm coming for respect. 
 Bitch I love this life. 
 I wouldn't trade it for the world. 
 I guess I'm selfish, right. 
. 
 It's Lil B. 
. 
 . 
 [Verse 3 - Lil B]. 
 Now I be off like Kim's shit. 
 Two mansion, five cribs. 
 That's that king shit. 
 Got so much money, on the whole. 
 Nothing leaves. 
 Dream is to deal with me. 
 Shit, young man doing what I'm. 
 Supposed to do. 
 I can hear the money speak. 
 I suppose it's true. 
. 
. 
 It said I'm coming soon. 
 But I'm dropping sooner. 
. 
 Let this shit drop when I cop the Sooner. 
 Lil B, I drop my back for the. 
 Love of the music. 
 I appreciate your mind and. 
 I appreciate your soul. 
 And that's just my promise. 
 I give you my soul and the music's promised. 
 Only one life, I'mma live it regardless. 
 Only one mic, look at what we started. 
. 
 Look at me now: how I get so tight. 
 Day in, day out, bitch I seen that light.

There's a lot of shit I"m still waiting for. 
 Still wondering. 
 Crying on this notepad. 
 . 
 [Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 Still waiting on healthcare. 
 Praying on welfare. 
 Gotta take my my hand up. 
 Gotta move my mind in. 
 Spend a lot of time there. 
 Getting on my grind there. 
 Throwing gang signs then. 
 Got a peace of mind there. 
 But I can't leave cause. 
 I know a piece of mine there. 
 People I grew up with don't. 
 Wanna see me shining. 
 So I grew up with a lot of things . 
. 
 People do bad stuff. 
 Wanna stay away from it. 
 Got my mind write so I won't. 
 Sleep in the casket. 
 Death around the corner. 
 And life is in the basket. 
 That's left from a woman, cause. 
 The death of a woman. 
 Means one less man. 
 So give respect to a woman. 
 I guess we just looking. 
 If you could see how I see it. 
 It's pain in your eyes, show em. 
 Bleed how I'm bleeding. 
 Just wanna talk, just one thing. 
 Won't forget what you did. 
 Just accept one thing:. 
 I'm still waiting. 
 . 
 You know there's so much in my life. 
 I feel like I'm still waiting. 
 You know what I mean. 
. 
 . 
 [Verse 2 - Lil B]. 
 You could pick and choose. 
 You could win or lose. 
 You could sink or swim. 
 You could stay or move. 
 Just had to amass. 
 I match the groove. 
 I match the plan. 
 I match the mood. 
 Even though I'm from the hood. 
 I'm a classy dude. 
 Like Nat King Cole. 
 I'm a faster blues. 
 I have the blues just hearing news. 
 Can't go a while. 
 Without seeing the food. 
 Am I just a judge. 
. 
 Am I just in love. 
. 
 This thing called life:. 
 Can I give it a hug. 
. 
 Can I trust in thugs. 
. 
 Don't hold no grudge. 
 Niggas love to hate. 
 But don't show no love. 
 And that's old man thinking. 
 If you closed-minded thugging. 
 That's no man's hustle. 
 No house, no home, no car, no budget. 
 No old, no young, but the ladies love him. 
 . 
 Still grinding. 
 Let the bitch niggas know that I won't stop. 
 I still hustle from the bottom to the top. 
 . 
 [Verse 3 - Lil B]. 
 The hood feel like the invisible hood. 
 I'm the ghost in the trees. 
 I produce this wood. 
 I rap on the tracks that make the block. 
 Go crazy and the suburbs love me. 
 Word to cousin. 
 Right around the time I was hurting. 
 Struggling, this dude had my back. 
 Gave me motivation. 
 I was asleep on the floor. 
 In the . 
. 
 Taking trips with the money. 
 Paying for some changes. 
 Things started changing slowly. 
 Had the floormap. 
 Even helped the homies. 
 Got a new ride just to show the homie. 
 Bought my main bitch a flight. 
 Kissed her, says she's lonely. 
 I don't love her, groupie's a bitch. 
 That's word to Stunna. 
 Shoutout to Birdman, that's word to Stunna. 
 I touch down in the hood. 
 I'm off the flight and blunted. 
 Lil Boss, I'm hundreds. 
.

 [Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 Most of the world live in blindness.

 Make you wanna strap up and murder everybody blocking. 
 What's really going on. 
 You know, what's really going on.

 Everybody want the throne and then you gonna die alone.

 And the game is getting shady/outlandish. 
 There's voices in my head and I can't really understand em.

[Verse 1: Lil B]. 
 Dog down the street, had a infamous, code name. 
 Blow mayne, narcotics, collecting all profit. 
 I done stopped to see my niggas, not tonight. 
 Cuz tonight be the day I come up, over night. 
 Suck it up the pain and jail time, suckas stuntin' on me writing 26. 
 As a kid resemblin', everything I thought about. 
 . 
 [Verse 2: Lil B]. 
 I didn't have priorities. 
 Cheap change, small talk. 
 Hitting scams for multiple dollars, mobile to solid. 
 Before I started rapping, the streets were my college. 
 I passed with honors, write a book to, capture my knowledge. 
 Audio or visual man the teachers is power. 
 Because I'm dead. 
. 
I don't relate to you cowards. 
 Power. 
 . 
 [Lil B talking]. 
 Living dead, we trapped. 
 This hood man, remember the hood is a mindset. 
 Being a thug, being from the hood that's a mindset. 
 Respect who respects you. 
 . 
 [Verse 3: Lil B]. 
 Trapped in this bullshit. 
 Parking tickets killing me. 
 Taxes on the right side. 
 Ain't nobody feeling me. 
 When we make money why is it given to the government. 
. 
 Got a new President but ain't nobody feeling him. 
 I'll overturn the government, but ain't nobody feeling that. 
 Y'all muh fuckas. 
. 
even scared to rap. 
 Speak your mind. 
 . 
 [Verse 4: Lil B]. 
 I'm trapped because the brothers that's resembling my complexion. 
 Is standing at the stop signs and the intersections. 
 Yeah I'm discriminating. 
 But my age group is hard to find friends most of em is eliminated. 
 Watching TV, turned on seen ElimiDate. 
 Man teach me how to buy property, in 50 states. 
 Teach me about some real shit. 
 . 
 [Lil B talking]. 
 Even though that's real life. 
 Teach me about some taxes. 
 Why didn't nobody teach me about taxes on TV. 
. 
 Why don't nobody teach us about none of that man. 
. 
 What's going on. 
. 
 Why don't people teach us about getting together. 
. 
 That's why we're trapped. 
 . 
 [Verse 5: Lil B]. 
 How the fuck the oil spill, in the mother fucking ocean. 
 Alotta people talk the game but really need devotion. 
 See how I see things, my philosophy is intricate. 
 I grew up in the hood, but I privileged experience the visuals, that I seen. 
 . 
 [Verse 6: Lil B]. 
 Take it from me, man appreciate your time here. 
 Cuz even if you overlook, just know my mind here. 
 Plus I understand from, underground to mainstream. 
 Mainstresam dick suck. 
 Underground no cash. 
 Fuck that, make your own life. 
 Fantasize rap I got a structure for the fucking human race. 
 But it's time we explore, jog in place with the race. 
 Win a race. 
 Appreciate death. 
 Then I place. 
 . 
 [Lil B talking]. 
 Let's get out the hood y'all, let's get out that mind state. 
 The hood is a trap, remember that. 
 Just keep that positive, get your core friends that love you. 
 And motivate your friends. 
 It's time to start being honest. 
 Just know it's all a trap. 
 The hood is a mind state, remember that.

 [Hook] x 4


[Intro]. 
 I think something is burning. 
 And now you've ruined the whole thing. 
 . 
 [Verse 1]. 
 I wish I could move but I'm closed in. 
 My heart getting old in a young man. 
 I've given up on every other man. 
 Positive is of the plans. 
 The human show me suffering. 
 It's most wanted in communities:. 
 Taxes and water is adored like. 
 Oil when it's poured in the ocean. 
 By mistakes of machines. 
 Cause we're lazy human beings. 
 Discreditin' our genes. 
 We're very smart nonetheless. 
 But enslave our own selves. 
 As color is division. 
 Who made up these visions. 
. 
 Wanna slap him for his actions. 
 My heart burn with passion. 
 . 
 [Bridge]. 
 My heart's burning. 
 . 
 [Verse 2]. 
 Please let me see the road cleared. 
 The weed smoke is very clear. 
 Evident: my rap lyrics, heaven-sent. 
 Underground legend to a small few. 
 Mainstream to most ones. 
 Close run, Uh, root for me. 
 Like I haven't won none. 
 Scream like it's no lungs. 
 And take it loud. 
 I'm talking loud. 
 Don't nobody hear me. 
. 
 Don't nobody care. 
. 
 I seem to stare at walls. 
 My eyes red, devilicious. 
 Eyed 'em. 
. 
 The people made me into a monster. 
 My heart getting darker. 
 Ridiculed for what. 
. 
 Because I'm looking at you awkward. 
. 
 I'm saying what I feel, bitch. 
 And I'm moving forward. 
 I'm at the point where I idolize lawyers. 
 People's liars. 
 Undercover with suppliers. 
 Tryin' to buy 'er. 
 Always purchased. 
 Filled my pain at the surface. 
 Staying all night like a nurse is. 
 This studio, I cursed it. 
 . 
 [Bridge]. 
 I lost my mind. 
 Check me, I lost my mind. 
 . 
 [Verse 3]. 
 You made me two faced. 
 Your burned my face. 
 To live on earth with people is beautiful. 
 Underneath, it's horrible. 
 I'm bleeding for this rap game. 
 Similar to crack 'caine. 
 I sold nothin'; focused. 
 Riding round town to the lonesome. 
 Scrooge McDuck, backseat phantom. 
 With a bad attitude:. 
 Fuck the world. 
 I think I'm burning.

[Verse 1: Lil B]. 
 I get mad cuz the world don't understand me. 
 That's the price I have to pay for this rap game. 
 Everybody see the good, they don't see the pain. 
 Like. 
. 
when you struggle they don't see the rain. 
 Analyze often niggas had to memorize. 
 Like walking down the streets fantasizin'. 
 Picking which thought like he looking out for houses. 
 Playa playa hating that's just something I can't pronounce'n. 
 When I'm at the top I will laugh at you bastards for doubting my emcee skills, I'm fantastic. 
 This sounds like this would be a Jay-Z classic. 
 Lil B classic. 
 Jay-Z mash it. 
 Phil you the best, where you going after passin'. 
 I rap so many damn hours now I got presents. 
 Listen to how I say it when the shit it's a message. 
 I found that the true meaning, is in the blessing. 
 . 
 It's a gift and a message. 
 . 
 Seing different things, it's a gift and a message. 
 . 
 [Verse 2: Lil B]. 
 Long hours, no sleep, no showers. 
 All rappin', no grind, no slackin'. 
 Street hustle, sell weed, pull packs in. 
 Shoulda been a linebacker how I'm baggin' sacks in. 
 New hustle, all voice, no ad-libs. 
 All me, new dream, new package. 
 Something like a new package how I'm gaining viewers. 
 2010 key word is computers. 
 Call me Donald Trump how I fire losers. 
 How Donald Trump fire workers, I fire rugers. 
 . 
 [Lil B talking]. 
 Haha, ay man, listen I said. 
 How Don-Donald Trump fire losers, I fire, oops. 
 I mean how dire Donald Trump fire workers I fire losers haha. 
 . 
 [Verse 3: Lil B]. 
 Like Macho Man bitch but I'm Lex Luger. 
 Glock 9 in the trunk, call it Martin Luther. 
 AK bullets spray bitch I can't box. 
 . 
 FUCK, listen, ay man like I said Blue Flame I don't give a fuck. 
 . 
 [Verse 4: Lil B]. 
 AK bullets spray, you can't dodge bazookas. 
 Ask me why I'm cool, because I'm not a loser. 
 But I know alotta losers and they'll bring it to ya. 
 I represent for the people dude. 
 . 
 Praying for you. 
 My motto live life move faster, age faster. 
 Didn't go to school but life keep me educated for the masters. 
 Didn't go to school, but I passed life honors with a masters. 
 Holla at me this a classic. 
 Blue Flame nigga, off the dome. 
 . 
 Everybody look out for Red Flame. 
 Rain In England, coming out. 
 Composed and produced all by Lil B The BasedGod, the BasedGod you'll never get a beat from. 
 I guarantee that, it's way too rare. 
 Red Flame coming very soon, download that, the second part to this to close the chapter.

Intro - Imogen Heap]. 
 You and me between the sheets, it just doesn't get better than this. 
 The many windswept yellow stickies of my mind. 
 Or the molten emotional front line. 
 I couldn't care less, I'm transfixed in this absolute bliss. 
 . 
 [Intro - Lil B]. 
 Illusions of Grandeur. 
 This is my pain and this is my life. 
 (Pray for me once again). 
 (Pray for my safety and pray for my health). 
 I have so many questions. 
 (Based World look over me). 
 I'm based for life. 
 (Please give me the strength to keep going). 
 I was a robber, turned positive. 
 . 
 [Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 The plans started out. 
 One guy, one gun. 
 Another person, so add one. 
 Two people, one gun. 
 One car they stole it from. 
 An unknown, ride slow. 
 One bottle of alcohol. 
 Two people with bad thoughts. 
 One time to lose it all. 
 You never learn, you never fail. 
 Never walk, you never crawl. 
 Back to the subject. 
 One lesson, two knuckle-heads. 
 One listen to the other. 
 They both robbing for the supper. 
 Lord forgive them. 
 One is. 
. 
. 
 The product of the environment. 
 Good upbringing with no father. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He took the harder route, regardless. 
 He was a little smaller. 
 To get respect he had to dog 'em. 
 For the girls. 
 He wanted to be the hero or anti-hero. 
 One dude was a nerd. 
 Got picked on and went berserk. 
 They both teamed-up. 
 Found a common and that was robbing. 
 Drinking liquor. 
 At the age to feel no pain. 
 We robbing brainless. 
 Deep for the cheddar. 
 A pain I can't explain. 
 To see that window shatter. 
 My blood's like a stain. 
 Tainted evidence, the pain. 
 Hard with the police. 
 Gather the evidence. 
 You ain't a robber, you ain't gon' feel this shit. 
 Maybe I ain't mainstream. 
 I cry cause I want the world. 
 I'm scared that these niggas would celebrate my death. 
 I guess. 
. 
. 
 The world is deep, novo. 
 Fuck you bitch. 
 I'm thugged out, I love this shit. 
 So educated I can go out and discuss this shit. 
 Bringing back matters to the public. 
 I like, I love it.

 This is the life of a robber.

It's your boy Lil B. 
 Realest nigga doing it, you feel me. 
 I'mma tell it like this:. 
 When I get I tracks I choose. 
. 
. 
 And it's very rare, if I get on your song you're lucky. 
. 
 . 
 [Verse 1 - Lil B]. 
 Nigga keep the lean right up under the speakers. 
 Certified street nigga, bruh, you couldn't believe it. 
 Quit fucking with me, you know I got the AK. 
 Wait a second bitch, you know I got the 50. 
 In New York I had a talk with 50. 
 Real street nigga made a freak 360. 
 Forever be a thug and I'll forever be 6th street. 
 Forever be 7th, you niggas got me fucked up. 
 Because I'm positive you niggas think that I'm a sucker. 
 Til I pull that 9 out and have you sleeping in the river. 
 My old G said "B you better dump the bitch. 
. 
 How you got a girlfriend and you don't even love yourself. 
". 
 Now I understand: wisdom over knowledge. 
 Bossed up nigga and I ain't even went to college. 
 And I ain't dissin niggas mad at my opinion. 
 Wishing I'mma fall, people hating from a distance. 
 But they don't really know I got the forward simulation. 
 Pull 211, make your whores stripping. 
 Nigga look back, I never Scott Pippen. 
 Michael Jordan king of the forest. 
 And after this, Scottie Pippen rich. 
 Don't compare me to them other little kids. 
 I got more hustle than a girl selling houses. 
 Dope up in the roof, nigga skiing over mountains. 
 Dope up in my nose and I'm looking like a skeleton. 
 Depressed in the hood, it's worse than it's ever been. 
 Dear Lord, please protect me from the Devilists. 
 These motherfuckers acting like we're friends but they breaking me. 
 Thank God I stay free: angel's prayer.
